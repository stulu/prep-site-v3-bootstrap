                <h1>The World of English Prepositions</h1>
                <p>First thing to remember is that you will make mistakes when using the good old English preposition.
                    Infact, you will commonly see even natives making mistakes with them, so don't feel down when you
                    inevitable make some when using them.
                    But just why do we make mistakes with them?
                    Well, there are around 150 of them, so that is probably the reason. Crazy right? &#128550;
                    Let's see some and their uses.
                    Search around the site and discover &#128270; the wonderful world &#127758; of prepositions.
                    Just remember you will make mistakes, so don't worry be happy! &#128578;</p>

                <h2>Defining Categories</h2>
                <p> Generally speaking, prepositions can be divided into eight categories: time, place, direction or
                    movement, agency, instrument or device, reason or purpose, connection, and origin.
                    Many prepositions fall under a few categories so context is the key to working them out. The table
                    below has some of the most common ones.</p> <br><br>
